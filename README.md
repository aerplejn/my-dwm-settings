# Dynamic Window Manager

**dwm** is a highly efficient, lightweight, and dynamic window manager tailored for X Window System on Linux. It's known for its simplicity, speed, and minimalistic approach to window management.

## Requirements

- **Xlib Header Files**: Essential for compiling dwm. Ensure these are installed on your system.

## Installation

1. **Edit `config.mk`**:
   - Adjust the settings in `config.mk` to suit your system environment. By default, dwm installs into the `/usr/local` directory. Modify this if you prefer a different location.

2. **Build and Install**:
   - Compile and install dwm with the following command. You may need to run this with superuser privileges:
   
     ```sh
     make clean install
     ```

## Running dwm

- **Starting via `.xinitrc`**:
  - To start dwm when you log in graphically, add the following line to your `.xinitrc` file:
  
    ```sh
    exec dwm
    ```

- **Specifying a Display**:
  - If you need to run dwm on a specific display, ensure the `DISPLAY` environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:
  
    ```sh
    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm
    ```
  
    This will launch dwm on display `:1` of the host `foo.bar`.

- **Displaying Status Information**:
  - To show real-time status like time and system uptime on the dwm bar, you can use this script in your `.xinitrc`:
  
    ```sh
    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
        sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm
    ```

## Configuration

- **Custom Configuration**:
  - dwm is configured by editing or creating a `config.h` file. Here's how you can personalize dwm:
    - **Edit `config.def.h`**: This file contains default configurations. Copy it to `config.h` to start customizing.
    - **Modify Settings**: Adjust keybindings, window management behaviors, colors, and other aspects to fit your preferences.
    - **Recompile**: After editing `config.h`, recompile dwm with:
    
      ```sh
      make clean install
      ```
  
  - For advanced users, you might want to explore patches on the official dwm website or community forums to extend functionality.

## Tips

- **Backup Before Changes**: Always keep a backup of your current `config.h` before making significant changes.
- **Test in Virtual Environment**: If possible, test new configurations in a virtual machine or another safe environment to avoid disrupting your main setup.
